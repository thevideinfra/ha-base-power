## Technical Details

- **Protocol**: gRPC-Web over HTTPS (not standard gRPC)
- **Authentication**: Clerk (email OTP → JWT with 60-second lifetime, native mobile API pattern)
- **Polling Interval**: 5 minutes
- **Battery**: 25 kWh per unit, auto-detects 1 or 2 battery configurations
- **Battery %**: Real SoC% from `MobileGetGridStatus` 15-min time series
- **Backup Time**: Computed as `(SoC% × capacity kWh) ÷ avg home power kW` from today's usage intervals
- **Service Location ID**: Auto-discovered via `MobileGetAvailableLocations` — not required during setup

## Changelog

Full notes for recent releases live in [`docs/releases/`](docs/releases/).

### v1.10.0
- **Fix: API errors no longer look like empty data** — a rejected token, HTTP error, or gRPC failure previously returned an empty payload that parsed into zeros, so an expired session showed as a 0% battery indefinitely and reauthentication was never triggered. Failed calls now surface properly and a rejected token starts a reauth flow
- **Fix: transient Clerk outages no longer force a re-login** — a 429/500/503 from Clerk raised an auth error, which logged you out and required a new emailed code. Only a genuine credential rejection (401/403) does that now; temporary failures simply retry on the next poll
- **Fix: Battery Connected now reports connectivity** — it was derived from remaining charge, so a drained but perfectly online battery read as disconnected, and an offline one read as connected
- **Fix: Battery Charging no longer flaps to "unknown"** — SoC telemetry updates every 15 minutes but polling is every 5, so most polls saw no change and reported unknown. Slow charging (under 0.5%/sample) was never detected at all. Both fixed by tracking the telemetry sample timestamp
- **Fix: Current Power picks the newest interval by timestamp** instead of assuming the API returns them in order
- **Fix: leaked connection on failed setup** — a failed first refresh left an unclosed session behind on every retry
- **Fix: crash on empty protobuf sub-messages** that could silently drop battery SoC, grid power and hourly usage for a poll
- **Fix: protobuf fields numbered 16 and above** were misread in the billing and energy parsers
- **Fix: correct minimum Home Assistant version** — the integration requires 2024.11 but claimed 2024.1, where it fails to load
- Grid outage binary sensor renamed to **Grid Status** so it no longer shares a display name with the Grid Power sensor
- WiFi Network selector moved to the device's configuration section
- Request timeouts added throughout so a hung call can't stall a poll cycle
- Sensor and binary sensor platforms rebuilt on entity descriptions (all entity IDs and history preserved)
- Debug logging no longer includes account metadata or full authentication error bodies
- `test_battery_count.py` moved to `scripts/probe_api.py`: the search term is now a command-line argument instead of a hardcoded SSID, saved credentials are written user-only, and resuming with an emailed code no longer starts a second sign-in

### v1.9.0
- Add **WiFi Network select entity** — a dropdown on the Base Power device card lets you choose a preferred WiFi network directly from Home Assistant, with available networks populated from a live scan sorted by signal strength
- Add **WiFi SSID dropdown in options** — the gear icon on the integration page now shows a live list of nearby networks with signal strength percentages instead of a plain text field; selecting "Auto (strongest signal)" clears the preference
- Add **battery unit count setting** — configure the number of battery units (1–10) via the gear icon on the integration page, useful when auto-detection doesn't match your actual hardware

### v1.8.0
- Fix battery count detection for 2-unit (50 kWh) systems — parser now counts repeated Field 3 sub-messages (one per battery unit) in addition to reading sub-field 1, so two-battery installs correctly report capacity and backup time
- Expanded protobuf debug logging: all unknown top-level fields are now logged with field number and value to aid future API reverse-engineering

### v1.7.0
- Auto-discover Service Location ID — setup is now email + OTP only, no manual ID lookup required
- Add Self-Sufficiency % sensor: `(solar + battery) ÷ total home consumption`
- Add Total Home Energy sensor: `grid + solar + battery` kWh (Energy Dashboard compatible)
- Add Battery Charging binary sensor: inferred from SoC delta between polls
- Add Daily Average Grid Interval sensor (already fetched, now exposed)
- Fix Solar Connected: falls back to `solar_to_home_kwh > 0` when API field is unset
- Fix Battery Backup Time: now a dynamic estimate from live SoC and average home load
- Energy Dashboard: add `suggested_display_precision` to all energy sensors

### v1.6.0
- Battery Level now shows real SoC% from `MobileGetGridStatus` (replaces self-calibration)
- Add Grid Power sensor: current draw in amps from the latest 15-min grid reading
- Add Daily Total (Grid) sensor: total kWh from the grid status summary
- Add parse support for rich `MobileGetGridStatus` response (battery SoC and power data)

### v1.5.0
- Add grid power outage detection binary sensor
- Add battery SoC from grid status API (replaces self-calibration when available)
- Add battery status enum sensor (Installed, In Service, etc.)
- Add WiFi signal strength and SSID diagnostic sensors
- Add energy breakdown sensors (grid-to-home, solar-to-home, battery-to-home)
- Add billing amount and due date diagnostic sensors
- Add asset ID diagnostic sensor
- Energy breakdown sensors are compatible with HA Energy Dashboard

### v1.4.0
- Remove device_class=ENERGY from non-cumulative sensors to fix HA state_class warnings
- Add debug logging for protobuf field identification
- Fix battery_count and has_solar field mappings

### v1.3.0
- Switch to native mobile API authentication pattern (`_is_native=1`)
- Add `x-mobile` header to match Clerk Expo SDK behavior
- Remove cookie-based auth in favor of Authorization header
- Extract session JWT directly from sign-in response when available
- Improved authentication reliability

### v1.2.0
- Dedicated Clerk session for auth (separate from HA's shared session)
- Token rotation tracking through full sign-in flow
- Debug logging for auth diagnostics

### v1.0.0
- Initial release with full sensor support
- Email OTP config flow
- gRPC-Web API integration
- Energy Dashboard compatible sensors

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed" during setup
- Ensure you're using the same email as your Base Power app account
- The verification code expires quickly — enter it promptly

### No data / sensors unavailable
- New installations may take time before telemetry data starts flowing
- Check that your battery is connected to WiFi in the Base Power app

### Reauthentication required
- Clerk sessions can expire. Go to the integration and click **Reconfigure** to re-authenticate.
